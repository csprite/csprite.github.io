# csprite web
This is the source of my csprite's website
hosted at https://csprite.github.io

The project uses [jelly](https://codeberg.org/0ref/jelly)
to generate the site & `build.sh` is used
to automate rebuilding & serving files on
local dev machine.

```sh
$ ./build.sh clean  # Clean Build Files
$ ./build.sh serve  # Build, Serve on localhost:4000 & Auto-Rebuild on changes
```
